// Folds over a Maybe value.
// - 1st: The type of the value inside Maybe.
// - 2nd: The type of the result.
// - 3rd: The value to return if the Maybe is None.
// - 4th: The function to apply to the value if the Maybe is Some.
// - 5th: The Maybe value to fold over.
// = Either the default value (if None) or the result of applying fn to the value (if Some).
